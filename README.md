## Protagonist Classes
### **Knight**
The Knight is the most balanced class. It has slightly more health
and defense values, but slightly lower strength value. However,
this is compensated for by a higher attack rating.

### **Assassin**
Assassins are the weakest class in terms of health. However, they
compensate for this by having the highest attack rating of all
classes. They also have high defense because they are better at
dodging.

### **Tank**
Tanks have the highest health and defense values of all classes.
However, they have a relatively low attack rating and strength.
