## Protagonist Subclasses

### **Knight**
The Knight is the most balanced class. It has slightly more health
and defense values, but slightly lower strength value. However,
this is compensated for by a higher attack rating.

### **Assassin**
Assassins are the weakest class in terms of health. However, they
compensate for this by having the highest attack rating of all
classes. They also have high defense because they are better at
dodging.

### **Tank**
Tanks have the highest health and defense values of all classes.
However, they have a relatively low attack rating and strength.


## Monster Subclasses

### **Monster**
These are your garden-variety monsters. They do a decent amount
of damage and have ordinary health. They're also the most common,
spawning about 50% of the time

### **Ninja**
Ninjas will attack you when you least expect it! They do 1.2x the
normal damage and, because of their elusive nature, they will be
harder to take down due to their amazing defensive skills.

### **Lich**
Liches are scary monster that use magic spells to deal the most
damage possible! They do a whopping 2x the normal monster damage

### **Dragon**
Dragons are HUGE monsters that have 500 hp! They take a while to
kill, but do an average amount of damage
