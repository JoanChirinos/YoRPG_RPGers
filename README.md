## Protagonist Subclasses

### **Knight**
The Knight is the most balanced class. It has slightly more health
and defense values, but slightly lower strength value. However,
this is compensated for by a higher attack rating.

### **Assassin**
Assassins are the weakest class in terms of health. However, they
compensate for this by having the highest attack rating of all
classes. They also have decent defense values because they are better at
dodging.

### **Tank**
Tanks have the highest health and defense values of all classes.
However, they deal relatively low damage.


## Monster Subclasses

### **Ninja**
Ninjas will attack you when you least expect it! They do 2.5x the
normal damage, but are slightly less elusive than other monsters.

### **Lich**
Liches are scary monster that use magic spells to deal a decent amount of 
damage! They deal 2.25x the normal monster damage

### **Dragon**
Dragons are HUGE monsters that have 500 hp! They take a while to
kill, but do an average amount of damage
